## How to Test Real-Time Transfer

### Step 1: Start the System
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd C:\Users\Praveen\Desktop\AqwaCloud_v1

# Start both servers
npm run dev:full
```

### Step 2: Access the Transfer Page
1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000/transfer`
2. You should see the transfer page with real-time features

### Step 3: Connect Services
1. **Connect Google Drive**:
   - Click "Connect Google Drive"
   - Authorize the application
   - You should see "Connected" status

2. **Connect OneDrive**:
   - Click "Connect OneDrive" 
   - Authorize the application
   - You should see "Connected" status

### Step 4: Enable Real-Time Transfer
1. **Toggle Real-Time Sync**: Enable the "Real-Time Sync" switch
2. **Select Source**: Choose Google Drive as source
3. **Select Destination**: Choose OneDrive as destination
4. **Select Files**: Choose files from Google Drive to transfer

### Step 5: Start Real-Time Transfer
1. Click "Start Real-Time Transfer" button
2. Watch the real-time progress updates
3. Monitor the statistics panel
4. Check the WebSocket server logs for activity

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **What You Should See**
1. **Transfer Job Created**: A new transfer job appears in the queue
2. **Real-Time Progress**: Progress updates from 0% to 100%
3. **WebSocket Activity**: Console logs showing WebSocket connections
4. **Statistics Updates**: Live statistics showing active sessions
5. **File Monitoring**: Files being monitored for changes
6. **Transfer Completion**: Transfer status changes to "completed"

### ✅ **Console Logs You Should See**
```
🚀 Starting real-time transfer session
📁 Source: Google Drive (google)
📁 Destination: OneDrive (microsoft)
📄 Files: [number of files]
✅ Transfer session started: session_[id]
📡 Received real-time update: progress
📊 Sync job update: transferring 50%
✅ Transfer completed successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Real-Time Transfer Doesn't Work

1. **Check WebSocket Server**:
   ```bash
   # Check if WebSocket server is running
   netstat -an | findstr :3001
   ```

2. **Check Next.js Server**:
   ```bash
   # Check if Next.js server is running
   netstat -an | findstr :3000
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors
   - Check for JavaScript errors

4. **Check Service Connections**:
   - Ensure both Google Drive and OneDrive are connected
   - Verify access tokens are present
   - Check connection status in the UI

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Session not found" Error**:
   - This is normal during cleanup
   - The error is handled gracefully
   - Does not affect transfer functionality

2. **WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Restart the WebSocket server: `npm run websocket`
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure port 3001 is available

3. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Re-authenticate with Google Drive
   - Re-authenticate with OneDrive
   - Check network connectivity
