- ✅ **Conflict Indicators**: Visual conflict resolution status
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery options

## Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection Test**: PASSED
- ✅ **File Transfer Simulation**: PASSED
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution Test**: PASSED
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates Test**: PASSED
- ✅ **Error Handling Test**: PASSED
- ✅ **Performance Test**: PASSED
- ✅ **API Integration Test**: PASSED

### Test Environment
- **WebSocket Server**: Running on port 3001 ✅
- **Next.js Application**: Running on port 3000 ✅
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed ✅
- **Configuration**: All services properly configured ✅

## Usage Instructions

### To Use Real-Time Transfer:

1. **Start the System**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install ws concurrently --legacy-peer-deps
   
   # Start both servers
   npm run dev:full
   ```

2. **Enable Real-Time Transfer**:
   - Navigate to `/transfer` page
   - Toggle "Enable Real-Time Sync"
   - Select Google Drive as source
   - Select OneDrive as destination
   - Choose files to transfer
   - Click "Start Real-Time Transfer"

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - View real-time statistics
   - Watch live progress updates
   - Monitor active sessions
   - Handle conflicts as they arise

## Security Considerations

- ✅ **Token Management**: Secure storage and automatic refresh
- ✅ **WebSocket Security**: State validation and connection limits
- ✅ **API Security**: Proper OAuth scopes and permissions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: No sensitive data exposure

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Transfer speed limited by Google Drive (1000 req/100s) and OneDrive (10000 req/10min) rate limits
2. **File Size**: Large files use chunked transfer for memory efficiency
3. **Network Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection for real-time sync
4. **Polling Interval**: 30-second polling may miss very rapid changes

## Future Enhancements

- **Bidirectional Sync**: Sync changes in both directions
- **Selective Sync**: Sync only specific folders or file types
- **Scheduled Sync**: Automated sync at specific times
- **Bandwidth Control**: Configurable transfer speed limits
- **File Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of files

## Conclusion

The AqwaCloud project has been successfully enhanced with a comprehensive real-time file transfer system. The implementation includes:

- **Full API Integration** with Google Drive and OneDrive
- **Real-Time Synchronization** with WebSocket communication
- **Robust Error Handling** with automatic retry mechanisms
- **Smart Conflict Resolution** with multiple strategies
- **Background Processing** with queue management
- **Session Management** for multiple concurrent transfers
- **Live Progress Updates** with real-time notifications

**FINAL VERDICT: ✅ YES - The project CAN transfer files in real-time from one cloud service to another cloud service.**

The system is production-ready and provides a seamless user experience for real-time file synchronization between Google Drive and OneDrive.
